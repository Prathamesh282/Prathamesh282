## Profile Summary

I am a **Bachelor of Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science)** candidate (Batch of 2026) with a strong focus on building **state-of-the-art, application-driven AI systems**. My work combines machine learning, data engineering, and embedded systems to address real-world and research-oriented problems.

I am particularly interested in:
- **Applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- **AI-driven decision support systems**
- **Legal-tech, health-tech, and assistive technologies**
- **End-to-end ML pipelines** (data → model → deployment)

My projects emphasize **problem formulation, model reasoning, and system design** rather than isolated experimentation.

---

## Technical Focus Areas

**Machine Learning & AI**
- Classical ML, feature engineering, model evaluation
- Deep learning pipelines and inference workflows
- NLP-based summarization and prediction systems

**Programming & Systems**
- Python (ML, data pipelines, APIs)
- C / C++ for embedded and sensor-level programming
- Swift for native iOS application development

**Platforms & Tools**
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Streamlit, FastAPI (for ML applications)
- ESP32-based embedded systems
- Git-based research and version control workflows

---

## Selected Projects

---

## Ongoing & Private Work

In addition to public repositories, I actively maintain **private repositories** involving:
- Advanced ML pipelines and MLOps experiments
- Research-oriented notebooks and datasets
- AI-based assistive technology prototypes
- Legal-tech and healthcare-focused applications

These are maintained privately due to research, evaluation, or publication considerations.

---

## Professional Intent

I am open to:
- Research collaborations  
- Internships & applied AI roles  
- Open-source contributions with real-world impact  

My long-term goal is to work on **high-impact AI systems that combine strong theory with practical deployment**.
